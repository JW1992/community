## **Objective**

Currently TF has no consistent, well-defined type promotion rules. This document proposes a well-defined, consistent and clear dtype promotion rule for TF. The introduced changes make TF APIs more similar to NumPy, with some differences that emphasize TFâ€™s applications in machine learning. This should make dtype promotions in TF much more consistent and predictable.
